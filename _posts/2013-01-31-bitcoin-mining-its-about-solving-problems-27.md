Are you a good problem solver? Well, then you may be a good candidate to get involved with bitcoin mining, because that is what the process is all about.

First of all, the discovery of bitcoins is itself called “solving” a block. In case you don’t know what that involves, it means that whatever the apparatus you are using to get the job accomplished, it is [going to do millions and millions of calculations](/what-is-proof-of-work/) in order to “solve” a very complex problem that, in truth, you don’t know the answer to going in. Heck, you only know what the parameters are, in general terms. So you can see how complex it actually is.

Have you ever heard the term “numbers crunching”? Well, this is just that – on steroids. In fact, if you went and asked people who have been mining for a number of years, the first thing they will do is warn you about how taxing the whole thing can be on the computer power you have at your disposal. It can indeed be VERY taxing.

Many people who are engaged in bitcoin mining do so by working in teams. As such, it does take some teamwork to make things happen. So it is imperative that you be able to cooperate with people for the purposes of working toward a common goal. When you get to that common goal, you may well discover that your efforts in bitcoin mining will have accomplished a great deal indeed! Just solve problems together!
