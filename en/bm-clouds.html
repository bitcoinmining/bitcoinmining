<p>Bitcoin cloud mining contracts are usually sold for bitcoins on a per hash basis for a particular period of time.
<p>For example, Pay per GHash/s would be 0.0012 BTC / GHs for a 24 month contract.
<p>Contracts vary from hourly to multiple years. The major factor that is unknown to both parties is the Bitcoin network difficulty and it drastically determines the profitability of the bitcoin cloud hashing contracts.
<p>Bitcoin network difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target.
